  Part 1: Design


    About This Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates using the Edument CQRS Starter Kit in order
to build up domain logic complete with tests. We'll also see how read
models can be built, and finally how to use the domain logic and read
models from a small ASP.NET MVC application.

The tutorial will work up towards the Cafe Sample Application that is
included with the kit. Therefore, you may like to have it open to refer
to as you work through the tutorial.


    The Domain

For this tutorial, we'll work in the cafe domain. Our focus will be on
the concept of a *tab*, which tracks the visit of an individual or group
to the cafe. When people arrive to the cafe and take a table, a tab is
*opened*. They may then *order* drinks and food. *Drinks* are *served*
immediately by the table staff, however *food* must be cooked by a chef.
Once the chef has *prepared* the food, it can then be *served*.

During their time at the restaurant, visitors may *order* extra food or
drinks. If they realize they ordered the wrong thing, they may *amend*
the order - but not after the food and drink has been served to and
accepted by them.

Finally, the visitors *close* the tab by paying what is owed, possibly
with a tip for the serving staff. Upon closing a tab, it must be paid
for in full. A tab with unserved items cannot be closed unless the items
are either marked as served or cancelled first.


    Events

In the scenario described above, various verbs and nouns were picked
out. When working in a database-centric way, it is common to listen
carefully for nouns, mapping them to tables and relating them. The verbs
are thus often a secondary concern. Designing in terms of commands and
events puts the focus on verbs instead, with the nouns being considered
a little later. This is good, since /things that make a domain
interesting tend to be captured by the verbs/ rather than the nouns.
Every business has customers (hopefully!) - it's what they do for them
that matters.

Looking through the scenario, focusing on the language we find within
it, we look for *things that happen* that lead to some kind of *new
information* in the domain. We map these happenings to a set of events.
Since events are about things that have taken place, they are named *in
the past tense*.

Here are a set of events we may come up with from the cafe tab scenario.

  * TabOpened
  * DrinksOrdered
  * FoodOrdered
  * DrinksCancelled
  * FoodCancelled
  * DrinksServed
  * FoodPrepared
  * FoodServed
  * TabClosed

Note that the events are very domain-focused. The difference between
ordering drinks and ordering food matters, so we capture these into
different events. Also note the verbs are from the domain, not generic
terms like "Created", "Updated", or "Deleted". While having such events
isn't automatically wrong, if they form the majority of what you have
then it's time to look deeper at the domain, and escape CRUD-think. Or
maybe what you're doing just isn't complex enough to warrant applying
DDD, in which case do something cheaper.


    Commands

Commands are things that indicate *requests* to our domain. While an
event states that something certainly happened, a command may be
*accepted* or *rejected*. An accepted command leads to zero or more
events being emitted to incorporate new facts into the system. A
rejected command leads to some kind of exception.

Commands are also identified by looking for verbs. However, they are
focused around *what the user considers as an operation*. For example,
while it is important that food and drink are handled differently in the
domain, table staff will most certainly not want to enter drinks into
the system and order them, then separately enter food into the system,
with no way to get an overview of the order being placed! It's likely
that each person at a table will specify their food and drink together,
and somebody will probably change their mind after learning what their
friend orders. Therefore, there will be a single command for placing an
order.

Here are the initial commands we arrive at for this domain:

  * OpenTab
  * PlaceOrder
  * AmendOrder
  * MarkDrinksServed
  * MarkFoodPrepared
  * MarkFoodServed
  * CloseTab

Notice how the names include a *verb in the imperative mood*.


    Exceptions

An important part of the modeling process is thinking about the things
that can cause a command to be refused. The Edument CQRS Starter Kit is
decidedly opinionated here: we are expected to model these "sad paths"
into exception types, just as commands and events are expressed as DTOs.
Furthermore, these exception types may carry details of /why/ the
request was not acceptable. This is because the domain logic should
*tell* the frontend what was wrong, rather than leaving it to *ask* by
trying to inspect some state - or worse, leave the user to guess.

Looking to the scenario, we can identify three notable exceptions we
need in our model:

  * CannotCancelServedItem
  * TabHasUnservedItems
  * MustPayEnough

The names here try to *explain why* the command failed.


    Aggregates

Of course, man does not live by verbs alone. At some point, there must
be nouns. More concretely, there has to be a way to talk about current
state in order to decide if a command should be accepted. For example,
to refuse to cancel a served item, we have to know that it was served.

All of the information we need is captured in the stream of past events,
since they capture all facts introduced into the system. However, we are
not, in general, intersted in the whole stream. Instead, we're
interested in the events that relate, for example, to *a particular
tab*. It's as if each tab should have its own event stream.

The missing piece here is known as an *aggregate*. Each aggregate has
its own stream of events. Taken together, they can be used to compute
its current state. Aggregates are completely isolated from each other.
Decisions about whether to accept a command are made /solely/ on the
basis of the command itself and the information contained in the
aggregate's past events.

Concretely, an aggregate is either:

  * A single object, which doesn't reference any others.
  * An isolated graph of objects, with one object designated as the
    *root* of the aggregate. The outside world should only know about
    the root.

This is demanding from a design perspective, as it forces us to
*identify and segregate business concepts*. It also means we have to
*really focus on consistency boundaries*.

Our current example has been carefully selected to have just one
aggregate type - namely, a tab. However, in most systems you will have
more work to do in order to identify aggregates. The authors of this
tutorial have found that starting from the events and commands, then
trying to group them based on invariants (business rules you need to
uphold), is a good strategy.


    Moving forwards

We're now ready to start writing test cases and building up our domain
logic. As we do so, we should be ready to revisit aspects of our design,
and we'll also need to flesh out the details of what our commands and
events contain.
